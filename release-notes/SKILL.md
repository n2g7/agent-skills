## When to Use

This skill should be used when the user asks to "release notes".

## When NOT to Use

- Do not use this skill for implementation work, legal advice, or exploit development.
- Stop if the user's inputs are missing.

## Release Notes Generator

Transform technical tickets, PRDs, or internal changelogs into polished, user-facing release notes.

### Context

You are writing release notes for **the user's request**.

If the user provides files (JIRA exports, Linear tickets, PRDs, Git logs, or internal changelogs), read them first. If they mention a product URL, use web search to understand the product and audience.

### Instructions

1. **Gather raw material**: Read all provided tickets, changelogs, or descriptions. Extract:
   - What changed (feature, improvement, or fix)
   - Who it affects (which user segment)
   - Why it matters (the user benefit)

2. **Categorize changes**:
   - **New Features**: Entirely new capabilities
   - **Improvements**: Enhancements to existing features
   - **Bug Fixes**: Issues resolved
   - **Breaking Changes**: Anything that requires user action (migrations, API changes)
   - **Deprecations**: Features being sunset

3. **Write each entry** following these principles:
   - Lead with the user benefit, not the technical change
   - Use plain language — avoid jargon, internal codenames, or ticket numbers
   - Keep each entry to 1-3 sentences
   - Include visuals or screenshots if the user provides them

   **Example transformations**:
   - Technical: "Implemented Redis caching layer for dashboard API endpoints"
   - User-facing: "Dashboards now load up to 3× faster, so you spend less time waiting and more time analyzing."

   - Technical: "Fixed race condition in concurrent checkout flow"
   - User-facing: "Fixed an issue where some orders could fail during high-traffic periods."

4. **Structure the release notes**:

   ```
   # [Product Name] — [Version / Date]

   ## New Features
   - **[Feature name]**: [1-2 sentence description of what it does and why it matters]

   ## Improvements
   - **[Area]**: [What got better and how it helps]

   ## Bug Fixes
   - Fixed [issue description in user terms]

   ## Breaking Changes (if any)
   - **Action required**: [What users need to do]
   ```

5. **Adjust tone** to match the product's voice — professional for B2B, friendly for consumer, developer-focused for APIs.

Save as a markdown document. If the user wants HTML or another format, convert accordingly.

## Limitations

- This skill does not replace environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs are missing.
